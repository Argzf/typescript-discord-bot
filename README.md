# TypeScript Discord Bot Template

A multi-purpose discord.js v14 bot template.
This is the successor of the [djs-template](https://github.com/ppauel/djs-template) repository.


## Features

- Slash Command Handler (global / guild)
- Context Menu Handler (global / guild)
- Interaction Handler (Message Components, Modals)
- Event Handler
- Sharding
- Localizations
- Customizable configuration
- [Examples](#demo-files)
## Installation

Install the required `npm` modules.

```bash
npm install
```

Create a new file called `.env` in the root directory and insert your bot token as shown in the `example.env` file.

### Configuration
Apart from the token, the configuration takes place in the `config.json` file located in the `src/` folder.

Specify a **guild ID** to which the guild commands will be deployed. Make sure that the bot is a member of this server and has sufficient permissions to create commands.
```json
"guild": "your_guild_id"
```

Choose if you want to receive **message components** and **modals** using the interaction handler.
```json
"receiveMessageComponents": true,
"receiveModals": true
```

Select whether to reply with a warning if an error occurs whilst executing an interaction.

```json
"replyOnError": true
```

Choose whether you want to split the custom ID of an interaction by **underscores** (_). In this case, the interaction handler uses only the string **before the first underscore** (if any).
This system makes sense if you want to use the custom ID to convey additional information.

For example `report_527814442746904591` is treated as `report`.
```json
"splitCustomId": false
```

If you want to use global commands only, you can disable guild commands. The `global` attribute must still be `true`.
```json
"useGuildCommands": true
```

**Done!** You can now experiment with some examples. For that, you just need to start your bot...
## Scripts

The bot can be started as a single instance or in processes intended for sharding. For smaller bots, the first variant should be sufficient.

To build & start the bot without sharding run

```bash
npm run start:bot
```
or just
```bash
npm run start
```

To build & start the sharding manager run

```bash
npm run start:manager
```

During development, it is a good idea not to deploy all commands every time you restart. You can use the following command to disable automatic deployment and run the uncompiled bot / manager.
```bash
npm run dev:bot
```
```bash
npm run dev:manager
```

To only compile a JavaScript build of your bot, run this command.
```bash
npm run build
```

The finished build will be located in the `dist/` directory.

## Usage / Examples
### Demo files
This template contains some sample commands and interactions so you understand how to use it:

- `src/commands/example/ping.ts` *Ping Command*
- `src/features/ping.ts` *Ping Button Builder*
- `src/interactions/buttons/example/ping.ts` *Ping Button Interaction*

- `src/context_menus/example/countCharacters.ts` *Message Context Menu*

- `src/context_menus/example/displayAvatar.ts` *User Context Menu*

**Hint:** *Commands, Context Menus and Interactions have to be located in a subfolder.*

### ExtendedClient class
To make it easier to access the client's config and collections, the template includes the `ExtendedClient` class. It allows to access these properties directly from the client without importing them.
```javascript
const client = new ExtendedClient();
const guildId = client.config.guild;
```
However, the `ExtendedClient` cannot be accessed through an API object such as message or an interaction. The included handlers pass the `_client` as its own parameter, so you don't have to worry about that.

### Localizations
By default, this project supports translations. These are managed in the `lang/` folder. The configuration is located in `src/features/i18n.ts`. Examples of usage can be found in the demo files.

## About this template
This template is still under development and will be constantly extended, for example when changes are made to the Discord API.
